### How To Install Ubuntu: Run Linux On Your Laptop Or PC

**Ubuntu’s standard installation** method is to download the **ISO Disk Image File** and burn it to a **CD** or **DVD**. Still, Canonical is aware that many netbook, notebook, and laptop users may not have access to a CD/DVD drive and that a USB stick is often preferred by most users anyway. Therefore, you have both methods available to install Ubuntu.

# Download the Installation Media

In a web browser, visit the [Ubuntu download page](https://ubuntu.com/download) and pick a version suitable for your machine. The most popular versions include:
- [Ubuntu Desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
- [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/download/server)
- [Ubuntu Derivatives](https://ubuntu.com/download/flavours)

Once you find the version you need, click the green **Download button**. You’ll be taken to a thank-you page, and your download should start. (We will download and install Ubuntu 20.04 for desktops.)

The download is an .iso file. You can use it to create a bootable USB drive.
Save the file to a location of your choice.

Run the file once downloaded.And Extract and use it.

 The balenaEtcher utility launches. Plug in the USB drive – you should see the drive pop up in the device field.

- In the Boot Selection drop-down, click Disk or ISO Image.
- Set the USB as the device you wish to write to.
- Click the Select button to the right.
- Browse and select the .iso Ubuntu file you downloaded earlier.
